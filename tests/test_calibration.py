"""Tests for two-point pH calibration (chemistry.compute_ph_calibrated).

Extracted from coordinator.py: _compute_ph_calibrated never used self.
Note: the real function does NOT round its result (unlike what an example
"7.4 -> 7.5357" might suggest) — hence pytest.approx instead of strict
equality.

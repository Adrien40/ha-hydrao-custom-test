"""GATT profile of Blueriiot-based Blue Connect probes.

Blueriiot probes expose a different GATT layout than the Zodiac probes handled
by the rest of the integration. This module only knows about those UUIDs and
decides, from the services a connected device exposes, which profile applies.

Every helper is defensive: anything that is not a usable GATT service
collection is simply "not Blueriiot", so a Zodiac probe always falls back to
the original code path.
